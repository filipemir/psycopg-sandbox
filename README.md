# Reproducing Psycopg Transaction Mystery

This is a small isolated reproduction of an issue that's puzzled me with Psycopg's
handling of transactions and its connection contexts

To run:

```
$ docker compose build

$ docker compose run python
```

You should see output like this:

```
 â ¿ Container psycopg-issue-db-1  Running
NOTICE:  schema "db" already exists, skipping

Run queries commands with autocommit disabled (default):
Record fetched using connection <psycopg.AsyncConnection [INTRANS] (host=db database=postgres) at 0xffffbba324d0>:

Run queries commands with autocommit enabled:
Record fetched using connection <psycopg.AsyncConnection [IDLE] (host=db database=postgres) at 0xffffbba32e00>:
None
Record inserted using connection <psycopg.AsyncConnection [INTRANS] (host=db database=postgres) at 0xffffbba32e00>:
(1, 'foo')
Record fetched using connection <psycopg.AsyncConnection [IDLE] (host=db database=postgres) at 0xffffbba324d0>:
(1, 'foo')
Record fetched using connection <psycopg.AsyncConnection [IDLE] (host=db database=postgres) at 0xffffbba324d0>:
(1, 'foo')
```

The puzzling behavior to me is the fact that, in the first set of commands, the first
fetch after the insert returns `None`. I'd expect the connection context in which the
preceding select statements are executed to commit that transaction, instead of
requiring an explicit commit. The second set of commands demonstrates that setting
`autocommit` to `True` does resolve the issue.

I found the DB logs instructive here too. For the first set of commands,
notice the `BEGIN`, `SAVEPOINT` and `COMMIT` statements:

```

	                    $1, $2
	                ) RETURNING *;

```

And for the second set of commands, notice that the only `BEGIN` and
`COMMIT` statements are the ones introduced in the one explicit
transaction for the `INSERT` statement:
